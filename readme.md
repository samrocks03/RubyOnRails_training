# ROR [ Ruby on Rails ]

## Module 4 : Modules

A CLI application for handling data from as many countries as we can. Example of what data we can have:
- Population
- GDP(Gross Domestic Production)
- States
- Army Strength
- State of the country(developing, developed) Etc.

<br>

On the basis of all these data we will be building modules to conceive various outputs like:
1. Whether that country will get a loan from the IMF (International Monetary Fund) or WB (World bank).

2. Whether the country can have a seat in the UN (United Nations) Security Council.

3. Whether the country can win the war or not
